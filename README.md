# Project Title : OclipAI

AI application would take long videos as input and convert them into short clips & memes. These clips would be easier for a larger population to consume and contain the humor of the original content.

# Brief About The Idea:
To address this problem, we propose the development of an AI-powered application. This application would take long videos as input and convert them into short-length clips or memes. These clips would not only be easier for a larger population to consume, but they would also encapsulate the essence and humour of the original content.
This approach allows the content to be more shareable, thus increasing its potential reach on social media platforms. By transforming long-form content into engaging, bite-sized pieces, we can enhance the accessibility and shareability of the content. This would help content creators reach a wider audience, boosting the popularity of their videos.

## How different is it from any other existing ideas out there?
- There is no such application out.
- The closest one is the summarizer for video content, While a summarizer for video content offers a condensed version of longer material, our application stands out by pinpointing the humorous segments, ensuring engagement and drawing viewers to the full content. It's about highlighting the laughter and captivating your audience from the get-go!

# How will it be valuable to Business ?
- It helps content creators create shorter and engaging versions of their content that are easier to share on social media, attracting a larger audience. Additionally, since the content is derived from longer videos, the shorter clips drive traffic to the main videos, thereby increasing their reach.
- It also assists in the opposite direction, as people often prefer to repeatedly watch the best parts of longer content, which our application will readily make accessible to them.

## Scalability:
- We can implement the same idea for different language contents too.
- Expanding our application's capabilities to predict humor, horror, suspense, thrill, and attitude enhances its versatility and applicability for diverse content analysis.

# Technology used:
- Vertex  APIâ€™s Model Garden:
- Gemini API/ Gemma with tuning: Using it for text processing and detecting humorous parts from it.
- Chirp API: Extracting text from the audio part of the clip and using it for further prediction.
- Codey API: Code compilation increases our speed in developing the application.
- Video Intelligence API: For analyzing the visual part of the clip
